This JavaScript has helper methods to perform various tasks automation.

### How to use?

![Instagram Helper](./images/InstagramHelperFlow.svg)

- Install [Chrome Browser](https://www.google.com/intl/en_in/chrome/)
- Create an empty temporary folder somewhere.
- Download the file [InstagramHelperChrome.vbs](./InstagramHelperChrome.vbs) and double click on it.
- Select that temporary created folder.
- That will then generate a Chrome Shortcut on your selected path with name `InstagramHelperChrome`
- Open that Special Chrome Browser using that shortcut. (Ignore the flag that says _You are using an unsupported comman-line flag: --disable-web-security. Stability and security will suffer_) (This flag is shown because we will be mimicking the automation process of Sending Request to Instagram using Chrome).
- Install [**Disable Content-Security-Policy**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/disable-content-security/ieelmcmcagommplceebfedjlakkhpden?hl=en) Extension.
- Open [Instagram.com](https://instagram.com) in new tab and click on CSP icon to enable them. *(It should turn pink)*
- Press `F12` (Developer Tools) or `Ctrl+Shift+I`
- Press `Ctrl+R` to reload the page.
- Paste the following code in the console tab.

```javascript

const script = document.createElement("script");
script.src = "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/pishangujeniya/instagram-helper@3.1/dist/InstagramHelper.min.js";
script.async = false;
document.head.appendChild(script);
setTimeout(() => {
    new InstagramHelper();
}, 2000);


```

### Prompts

|Input Message| Corresponding Meaning |
|--|--|
| Please enter your chat Thread ID. | Your chat thread ID. <img src="./images/chat_thread_id.png"> |
| Please enter number of recent messages you want to skip. Default is `10`. | The number of your recently sent messages which will be skipped and will not be deleted. If you do not enter any number then it will take by default 10 |
| Please enter number of seconds to randomly wait between each message to delete. Default is `3` seconds | Number of seconds to randomly wait between unsending each message, so that Instagram server do not think that the actions are automated. |
| Do you want to skip unsending text messages - `yes`/`no`? It means it will unsend media contents. Default is `no`. | If you provide `yes` then it will not unsend the text messages, and  starts unsending other type of messages such as *media*,*photos*, *videos* which you have sent. |


### ‚Åâ FAQ

#### üòñ Getting errors displayed in console while running the code
- There might be some errors related to Instagram site, not every error displayed on console are from our script.
- If error persists and repeats everytime, then close browser logout and relogin and then try running the code.

#### üòµ Getting too often "Try again tomorrow" Error or 429 Response Code?
- Try to close the browser re-open Instagram and logout then login.
- Try with more higher number of delay seconds.

#### ‚è≥ Why unsending is slow?
- Deleting messages is kept intentionally slow because Instagram has limit to delete number of messages in per second.
- If we delete fastly then Instagram servers detects it as bot and then unsending is not allowed with the session temporarily, until you logout and relogin. So to avoid getting detected, we have kept a delay in the code to delete messages with specific interval of time.
- It is very tedious and time consuming process, but efficient and better than doing it manually. One can simply open a new chrome browser window and follow the simple steps and minimise it.

#### üõë How to stop unsending process?
- Refresh the page or Close the browser or Restart the computer.

#### üòï How to see my downloaded messsages?
- Open the link [InstagramHelperDataViewer](./InstagramHelperDataViewer.html) to view the data.
